# django-vue-cli-multi-page-app
 Simple Django + Vue CLI multi page app inspired by [django-vue-cli-webpack-demo](https://github.com/EugeneDae/django-vue-cli-webpack-demo) and [vue-mpa-application-example](https://github.com/wandersonpjbkn/vue-mpa-application-example).
 
 I basically just combined both repos so that I can create multiple Vue pages in one Django project without having to use a CDN. Instead, Webpack will automatically put all dependencies into one folder. If you want to have more information, please click on these links above ☝️.
